Character Classification:

It checks if the current character is a letter, digit, or something unknown.

Token Recognition:

If it's a letter, it identifies it as an identifier (like a variable name).

If it's a digit, it treats it as an integer.

Special characters like +, -, *, (, ) are recognized as operators or punctuations.

Token Output:

For each recognized token, it prints the token type and the actual string (lexeme). For example, it might print:

vbnet
Copy
Next token is: 11, Next lexeme is x
indicating that x is an identifier.

The process continues until it reaches the end of file (EOF).

Example:
For input like x = 5 + 3, it prints:

vbnet
Copy
Next token is: 11, Next lexeme is x
Next token is: 20, Next lexeme is =
Next token is: 10, Next lexeme is 5
Next token is: 21, Next lexeme is +
Next token is: 10, Next lexeme is 3
This is a simple lexer that splits the input into tokens for further processing in a compiler or interpreter.
